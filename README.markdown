# Tasks.tmbundle

[TextMate](http://macromates.com/) bundle for simple to-dos and notes. Based on the  [Tasks.tmbundle](http://github.com/henrik/tasks.tmbundle), which was inspired by [TaskPaper](http://www.hogbaysoftware.com/products/taskpaper). This also takes inspiration from emacs [org-mode](http://orgmode.org/). 

## Usage

Currently supports a very simple set of syntax. 
* prefix a line with - followed by a space to make it a task
* there are three levels of bullets \*, \*\*, and \*\*\* each followed by a space
* create a header by finishing the line with :
* To toggle a task between complete and pending use Cmd-D
* At the end of a line, hit Ctrl-Return to start the next line with the same task/bullet prefix as this line  
* To promote or demote the header of the current (e.g., turn a ** bullet into a * bullet or vice versa) hit Cmd-< or Cmd->
